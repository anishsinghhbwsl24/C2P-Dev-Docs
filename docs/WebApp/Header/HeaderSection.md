## **WebApp Header Section**

The WebApp includes a **header section** displaying key statistics about the PDFs:

-   **Count of approved items**
    
-   **Count of assigned + approved items**
    
-   **Count of unassigned + assigned items**
    

This structured approach ensures an **efficient workflow** for managing PDF alignment issues in **Sigo Signs**, reducing errors and improving productivity.
