## **WebApp Header Section**

The WebApp includes a **header section** displaying key statistics about the PDFs:
1. Count of approved items
2. Count of assigned + count of approved items
3. Count of approved items 
4. Count of unassigned + assigned items

This structured approach ensures an **efficient workflow** for managing PDF alignment issues in **Sigo Signs**, reducing errors and improving productivity.
