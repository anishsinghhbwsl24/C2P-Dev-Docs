# WebApp

The WebApp is designed to **automate the process of fixing PDF alignment issues** in **Sigo Signs**. It allows designers to efficiently **review, approve, or deny PDFs**, ensuring that only properly aligned signs proceed to printing. The system also **automates the movement of files** between different folders based on their status, eliminating manual file handling and improving workflow efficiency.

## **Business Requirement**

The primary goal of the WebApp is to **automate the management of misaligned PDF files** and improve the efficiency of the sign approval process. Key business requirements include:

1.  **Automated File Movement:**
    
    -   Eliminate manual handling of files by automating the movement between directories based on their status (e.g., **Approved**, **Denied**, **Before Fixing**).
        
    -   **Automated File Transfer:** Files generated by C2P may have design issues like text misalignment, poor image quality, and inconsistent placement of elements. The designer reviews and fixes these files, moving them from the **ShipBy Folder** to the **Fixed Folder**. Manual movement of these files has led to sync issues and slowdowns due to Dropbox mounting on designer systems. The WebApp should automate the movement of files to the **Fixed Folder** after they are fixed.
        
2.  **Efficient Review and Approval Process:**
    
    -   Enable designers to **quickly approve or deny files** without needing to manually move files, reducing delays and errors.
        
    -   **Designer Performance Review:** The management would like to track and review each designerâ€™s performance, including design changes they make to files, to ensure quality control and accountability.
        
3.  **Optimized Workflow:**
    
    -   Streamline the process by assigning files to designers based on priority (e.g., **ShipBy Date**, **OrderType**, and **FIFO**) to enhance productivity.
        
    -   **Automatic Tracking and Reporting:** The WebApp should integrate performance tracking for each designer, including changes made to files, enabling management to monitor progress and adjust workflows for optimal efficiency.
