# KPI Dashboard

## **Business Requirement**

The primary goal of the KPI Dashboard is to provide critical insights into the **C2P (Convert to Print) bed management process**, enabling efficient production management and decision-making. Key business requirements include:

1. **Evaluating User Productivity:** 
    - Enable managers to assess individual user productivity across different production stages (printing, cutting, engraving), ensuring optimal workflow and to prevent user-underutilization.

2. **Identifying Bottlenecks in Production:** 
    - Quickly identify if specific sign sizes or beds are consuming more resources or bed space than expected, allowing for timely adjustments and improved resource allocation.

3. **Monitoring Printing, Cutting and Routing Efficiency:** 
    - Track the **average times** to identify inefficiencies, highlight underperforming stages, and improve the overall productivity of the printing, cutting and routing processes.

4. **Tracking Work in Progress:** 
    - Provide visibility into the **number of beds in different production stages**, enabling the identification of potential bottlenecks, managing workload distribution, and ensuring deadlines are met.

## KPI Dashboard: Components

The KPI Dashboard is built using the **DevExpress PivotGrid**, a powerful data analysis tool that allows for interactive summarization, filtering, and visualization of large datasets.
