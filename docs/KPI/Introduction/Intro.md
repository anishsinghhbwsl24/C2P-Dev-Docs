# KPI Dashboard

## Requirement: Use Cases

The KPI Dashboard is designed to provide insights into various aspects of the C2P (Convert to Print) order management process. Potential use cases include:

* **Identifying Bottleneck Sign Sizes:** Quickly determine if any particular sign size is consuming a disproportionate amount of printing resources or bed space.
* **Monitoring Printing Efficiency:** Track the average time taken to print a bed, enabling identification of inefficiencies and areas for improvement.
* **Evaluating User Productivity:** Gain visibility into individual user activities and their efficiency in different stages of the production process (printing, cutting, engraving). This can help in resource allocation and performance evaluation.
* **Tracking Work in Progress:** Monitor the number of beds currently in different stages of production (printing, cutting, engraving) to understand the workload and potential bottlenecks.

## Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Dashboard Evolution

The KPI Dashboard was initially developed to track user-specific statistics. Its functionality has since been expanded to include comprehensive bed-related statistics, providing a holistic view of the production process.

## Technology Used: DevExpress PivotGrid

The KPI Dashboard is built using the **DevExpress PivotGrid**, a powerful data analysis tool that allows for interactive summarization, filtering, and visualization of large datasets.
